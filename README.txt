FOG'S CROSSHAIRS:
-----------------
Fog's Crosshairs are enabled by default. 
To disable them, navigate to your hudlayout.res file, found in the scripts folder. Change the "enabled" value under the Fog's Crosshairs heading to "0". 

If you wish to change the crosshair used, then open the included crosshairs.png image file and match your desired crosshair to the character and insert that character of the crosshair in the "labeltext" line.
	
Crosshair flash when you hit a player is enabled by default.  To disable, find HudAnimations_tf.txt in the scripts folder and remove everything between the { and } brackets under the heading DamagedPlayer.
